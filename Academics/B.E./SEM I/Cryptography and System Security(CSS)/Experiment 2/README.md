**Aim:** Identify Phishing attack and justify.

**Theory:**

**Introduction:** Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. The word is a neologism created as a homophone of fishing due to the similarity of using fake bait in an attempt to catch a victim. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting victims. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users, and exploits the poor usability of current web security technologies.

Hackers commonly take advantage of these sites to attack people using them at their workplace, homes, or in public in order to take personal and security information that can affect the user or company. Phishing takes advantage of the trust that the user may have since the user may not be able to tell that the site being visited, or program being used, is not real; therefore, when this occurs, the hacker has the chance to gain the personal information of the targeted user, such as passwords, usernames, security codes, and credit card numbers, among other things.

**Types of Phishing Attacks:**

**1. Deceptive Phishing:** The term "phishing" originally referred to account theft using instant messaging but the most common broadcast method today is a deceptive email message. Messages about the need to verify account information, system failure requiring users to re-enter their information, fictitious account charges, undesirable account changes, new free services requiring quick action, and many other scams are broadcast to a wide group of recipients with the hope that the unwary will respond by clicking a link to or signing onto a bogus site where their confidential information can be collected. 

**2. Malware-Based Phishing:** It refers to scams that involve running malicious software on users' PCs. Malware can be introduced as an email attachment, as a downloadable file from a web site, or by exploiting known security vulnerabilities--a particular issue for small and medium businesses (SMBs) who are not always able to keep their software applications up to date.

**3. Key-loggers and Screen-loggers:** These are particular varieties of malware that track keyboard input and send relevant information to the hacker via the Internet. They can embed themselves into users' browsers as small utility programs known as helper objects that run automatically when the browser is started as well as into system files as device drivers or screen monitors. 

**4. Session Hijacking:** It describes an attack where users' activities are monitored until they sign in to a target account or transaction and establish their bona fide credentials. At that point the malicious software takes over and can undertake unauthorized actions, such as transferring funds, without the user's knowledge. 

**5. Web Trojans:** These pop up invisibly when users are attempting to log in. They collect the user's credentials locally and transmit them to the phisher. 

**6. Hosts File Poisoning:** When a user types a URL to visit a website it must first be translated into an IP address before it's transmitted over the Internet. The majority of SMB users' PCs running a Microsoft Windows operating system first look up these "host names" in their "hosts" file before undertaking a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup. By "poisoning" the hosts file, hackers have a bogus address transmitted, taking the user unwittingly to a fake "look alike" website where their information can be stolen. 

**7. System Reconfiguration Attacks:** This attack modify settings on a user's PC for malicious purposes. For example: URLs in a favorites file might be modified to direct users to look alike websites. For example: A bank website URL may be changed from "bankofabc.com" to "bancofabc.com". 

**8. Data Theft:** Unsecured PCs often contain subsets of sensitive information stored elsewhere on secured servers. Certainly PCs are used to access such servers and can be more easily compromised. Data theft is a widely used approach to business espionage. By stealing confidential communications, design documents, legal opinions, employee related records, etc. 

**9. DNS-Based Phishing (a.k.a "Pharming"):** Pharming is the term given to hosts file modification or Domain Name System (DNS)-based phishing. With a pharming scheme, hackers tamper with a company's hosts files or domain name system so that requests for URLs or name service return a bogus address and subsequent communications are directed to a fake site. The result: users are unaware that the website where they are entering confidential information is controlled by hackers and is probably not even in the same country as the legitimate website.

**10. Content-Injection Phishing:** It describes the situation where hackers replace part of the content of a legitimate site with false content designed to mislead or misdirect the user into giving up their confidential information to the hacker. For example, hackers may insert malicious code to log user's credentials or an overlay which can secretly collect information and deliver it to the hacker's phishing server. 

**11. Man-in-the-Middle Phishing:** It is harder to detect than many other forms of phishing. In these attacks hackers position themselves between the user and the legitimate website or system. They record the information being entered but continue to pass it on so that users' transactions are not affected. Later they can sell or use the information or credentials collected when the user is not active on the system. 

**12. Search Engine Phishing:** It occurs when phishers create websites with attractive (often too attractive) sounding offers and have them indexed legitimately with search engines. Users find the sites in the normal course of searching for products or services and are fooled into giving up their information. For example, scammers have set up false banking sites offering lower credit costs or better interest rates than other banks. Victims who use these sites to save or make more from interest charges are encouraged to transfer existing accounts and deceived into giving up their details. 

Ways to Avoid Phishing:

1. Guard against spam. Be especially cautious of emails that: 

          Come from unrecognized senders. 

          Ask you to confirm personal or financial information over the Internet and/or make urgent requests for this
          information. 

          Aren’t personalized. 

          Try to upset you into acting quickly by threatening you with frightening information.

2. Communicate personal information only via phone or secure web sites. In fact: 

          When conducting online transactions, look for a sign that the site is secure such as a lock icon on the 
          browser’s status bar or a “https:” URL whereby the “s” stands for “secure” rather than a “http:”. 

          Also, beware of phone phishing schemes. Do not divulge personal information over the phone unless you  
          initiate the call. Be cautious of emails that ask you to call a phone number to update your account
          information as well.

3. Do not click on links, download files or open attachments in emails from unknown senders. It is best to open attachments only when you are expecting them and know what they contain, even if you know the sender.

4. Never email personal or financial information, even if you are close with the recipient. 

          You never know who may gain access to your email account, or to the person’s account to whom you are
          emailing.

5. Beware of links in emails that ask for personal information, even if the email appears to come from an enterprise you do business with. Phishing web sites often copy the entire look of a legitimate web site, making it appear authentic. To be safe, call the legitimate enterprise first to see if they really sent that email to you. After all, businesses should not request personal information to be sent via email. 

6. Beware of pop-ups and follow these tips: 

          Never enter personal information in a pop-up screen. 

          Do not click on links in a pop-up screen. 

          Do not copy web addresses into your browser from pop-ups. 

          Legitimate enterprises should never ask you to submit personal information in pop-up screens, so don’t do it.

7. Protect your computer with a firewall, spam filters, anti-virus and anti-spyware software. Do some research to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date software, and update them all regularly to ensure that you are blocking from new viruses and spyware. 

          Check your online accounts and bank statements regularly to ensure that no unauthorized transactions have
          been made.

**Conclusion:** Thus we have studied guidelines for identifying phishing techniques.
