**Aim:** Write a program to implement classic/traditional cipher techniques such as substitution and Transposition Cipher.

**Theory:**

**What is a Cipher?**

          A cipher is any method of encrypting text. It is also sometimes used to refer to the encrypted

     text message itself although here the term cipher text is preferred.

     Substitution Cipher: In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encoding by

     which units of plaintext are replaced with cipher text, according to a fixed system; the &quot;units&quot;

     may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the

     above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution.

     Substitution ciphers can be compared with transposition ciphers. In a transposition cipher, the

     units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units

     themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are

     retained in the same sequence in the cipher text, but the units themselves are altered.

          There are a number of different types of substitution cipher. If the cipher operates on single

     letters, it is termed a simple substitution cipher; a cipher that operates on larger groups of

     letters is termed polygraphic. A mono alphabetic cipher uses fixed substitution over the entire

     message, whereas a polyalphabetic cipher uses a number of substitutions at different

     positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several

     possibilities in the cipher text and vice versa.

          The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of

     substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is &#39;shifted&#39; a certain number of places

     down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would

     become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to

     communicate with his generals.
